    <h3>Why do we use it?</h3> 
    <p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be
    <em>distracted by the readable</em> content of a page when looking at its layout. The
    point of using <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is that it has a more-or-less normal <u>distribution
    of letters</u>, as opposed to using <mark>'Content here, content here'</mark>, making it look
    like readable English.</p> <p>Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
    now use <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> as their <small>default model text</small>, and a search for <strong>'lorem
    ipsum'</strong>  will <sub>uncover</sub> many <sup>web sites</sup> still in their infancy. Various versions
    have evolved over the years, <del>sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
    (injected humour and the like)</del>.</p>
